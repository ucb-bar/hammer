End-to-End Integration Tests
============================

In the ``e2e/`` folder, there is a example of a bare Hammer project setup with tool plugin submodules, Hammer IR snippets in the ``configs/``, ``env/``, and ``pdks/`` subfolders, and Verilog files in the ``src/`` subfolder. 

``pyproject.toml`` is an example of how to install Hammer as a source dependency, and for Berkeley affiliates, the envs are particularly useful for setting up your tool paths and license servers.

Refer to ``e2e/README.md`` for details of how to run the tests.
