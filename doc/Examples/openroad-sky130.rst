OpenROAD and Sky130
=======================================

The `OpenROAD-flow <https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow>`__ is an open-source, technology-independent VLSI toolchain. 
As of this writing, it has the ability to run synthesis, place-and-route, and drc through various open-source tools. 

Hammer has the ability to target the OpenROAD toolchain and the Skywater 130nm PDK. 
So you can now simply push a button in `Chipyard <https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard>`__ to go from your Chisel design to a somewhat reasonable gds at an example 130-nm node.

Instructions
---------------------------

Follow `these directions in the Chipyard docs <https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/VLSI/Sky130-OpenROAD-Tutorial.html>`__ to build your own design with OpenROAD and Sky130.
