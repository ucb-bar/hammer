# Configuration options and defaults for OpenROAD's par tools.
# The values specified in this file are the defaults.

par.openroad:
  openroad_bin: "openroad" # Location of the openroad binary.
  version: "dummy-value" # this is just to make hammer happy (although, it is never called AFAICT).
  # the version is actually calculated by the OpenROADTool class

  klayout_bin: "klayout" # Location of the klayout binary.

  generate_only: false # Generate the TCL file but do not run it yet.

  create_archive_mode: none
  # Generate the tar.gz archive of the current build/par-rundir directory with a runme.sh script to reproduce the results
  # Valid options are:
  # - none - never create an archive
  # - after_error - if OpenROAD errors, create an archive of the run
  # - always - create an archive after every par run (regardless of whether OpenROAD errors)
  # - latest_run - create an archive of latest par run (don't run OpenROAD)
  #                  (useful if OpenROAD gets stuck on endless optimization iterations but never actually "errors")
  # type: str

  timing_driven: true  # generate GDS as fast as possible
  # skips as many optimizations as possible, including write_reports
  # type: bool

  write_reports: true  # generate various timing/area/power reports throughout the PAR flow
  # setting this to false significantly speeds up runs and reduces log output
  # type: bool

  floorplan_mode: generate # Floorplanning SDC constraints to use.
  # Valid options are:
  # - blank - Specify no floorplanning constraints (likely won't work)
  # - generate - Generate a floorplan from the hammer-vlsi config/IR.
  # - auto_macro - Use OpenROAD's `macro_placement` command to auto-generate macro placements.
  #                Chip top-level constraints must still be specified (i.e. width, height)
  # - manual - Specify the contents of a manual floorplanning script to use in floorplan_script_contents.
  #            If you specify 'manual', you must also specify the floorplanning_script config below. The floorplanning_script config will be ignored in other modes.
  # type: str

  floorplan_script_contents: null
  # type: Optional[str]

  floorplan_origin_pos: bottom_left
  # Only used when par.openroad.floorplan_mode == generate
  # By default, OpenROAD places the macros THEN rotates them, but it is convenient to always 
  #   have the macro (x,y) position correspond with bottom left corner of the placed macro
  # Valid options are:
  # - bottom_left - width & height of macro must be specified to use this option (or else will use 'rotated' option)
  # - rotated
  # type: str

  setrc_file: null # Gate Resizer layer RC settings
