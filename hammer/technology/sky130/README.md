Sky130 Technology Library
=========================
Hammer supports the Skywater 130nm Technology process. The [SkyWater Open Source PDK](https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/) is a collaboration between Google and SkyWater Technology Foundry to provide a fully open source Process Design Kit (PDK) and related resources, which can be used to create manufacturable designs at SkyWaterâ€™s facility.


PDK Setup
---------

The Skywater 130nm PDK files are located in a repo called [skywater-pdk](https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk/). A tool called [Open-PDKs (open_pdks)](https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks/) was developed to generate all the files typically found in a PDK.
Open-PDKs uses the contents in `skywater-pdk`, and outputs files to a directory called `sky130A`.

### PDK Install

```shell
# create a root directory that will contain all PDK files and supporting tools (install size is ~42GB)
export PREFIX=/path/to/install/root
mkdir -p $PREFIX
cd $PREFIX

# install magic via conda, required for open_pdks
conda create -y -c litex-hub --prefix $PREFIX/.conda-signoff magic
export PATH=$PREFIX/.conda-signoff/bin:$PATH

# clone required repos
git clone https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk.git
git clone https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks.git

# install Sky130 PDK via Open-PDKs
#    we disable some install steps to save time
cd $PREFIX/open_pdks
./configure \
    --enable-sky130-pdk=${PREFIX}/skywater-pdk/libraries --prefix=$PREFIX \
    --disable-gf180mcu-pdk --disable-alpha-sky130 --disable-xschem-sky130 --disable-primitive-gf180mcu \
    --disable-verification-gf180mcu --disable-io-gf180mcu --disable-sc-7t5v0-gf180mcu \
    --disable-sc-9t5v0-gf180mcu --disable-sram-gf180mcu --disable-osu-sc-gf180mcu
make
make install
```

This generates all the Sky130 PDK files and installs them to `$PREFIX/share/pdk/sky130A`

Now in your Hammer YAML configs, point to the location of this install:

```yaml
technology.sky130.sky130A: "<PREFIX>/share/pdk/sky130A"
```


SRAM Macros
-----------

If you are using SRAMs in your design, such as for the [Chipyard Sky130 tutorial](https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/stable/VLSI/Sky130-Commercial-Tutorial.html),
you will require a set of SRAM macros.
The Sky130 PDK did not come with it's own SRAM macros, so these have been generated by various third-party contributors.
Hammer is compatible with Sky130 SRAM macros generated by 
[Sram22](https://github.com/rahulk29/sram22_sky130_macros)
and [OpenRAM](https://github.com/efabless/sky130_sram_macros),
but starting with Hammer v1.0.2 only Sram22 macros will be supported.
To obtain these macros, clone their github repo:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/rahulk29/sram22_sky130_macros
```

Then set the respective Hammer YAML key:

```yaml
technology.sky130.sram22_sky130_macros: "/path/to/sram22_sky130_macros"
```

Note that the various configurations of the SRAMs available are encoded in the file ``sram-cache.json``.
To modify this file to include different configurations, or switch to using the OpenRAM SRAMs,
navigate to ``./extra/[sram22|openram]`` and run the script ``./sram-cache-gen.py`` for usage information.

IO Library
----------

The IO ring required by efabless for MPW/ChipIgnite can be created in Innovus using the `sky130_fd_io` and `sky130_ef_io `IO cell libraries. Here are the steps to use them:

1. `extra/efabless_template.io` is a template IO file. You should modify this by replacing the `<inst_path>`s with the netlist paths to your GPIO & analog pads. **DO NOT MODIFY ANY POSITIONS OR REPLACE CLAMP CELLS WITH IO CELLS**.

    a. For pad assignment: the ordering in the instance lists are from left to right (for top/bottom edges) and **bottom to top (for left/right edges)**.

    b. Refer to [this documentation](https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/main/contents/libraries/sky130_fd_io/docs/user_guide.html) for how to configure the pins of the IO cells (not exhaustive).

    c. Your chip reset signal must go thru the `xres4v2` cell. Since this is in your netlist, you must remove the `cell=...` instantiation from your IO file (it is only in the template for clarity) and update the inst name. Otherwise a separate instance will be placed instead.

    d. The `ENABLE_INP_H` pin must be hard-tied to `TIE_HI_ESD` or `TIE_LO_ESD`. Since this is at a higher voltage, verify that this is routed as a wire only (no buffers can be inserted).

    e. `ENABLE_H` must be low at chip startup before going high. Absent using the power detector cell from the NDA IO library, you may elect to connect this to a reset signal.

    f. This template file does not contain dedicated clamps for the `VSWITCH` or `VCCHIB` supplies (following Caravel). EFabless provides a `sky130_ef_io__connect_vcchib_vccd_and_vswitch_vddio_slice_20um` slice in `open_pdks` that replaces a standard 20um spacer with a slice that connects `VCCHIB` and `VCCD` together, and `VSWITCH` and `VDDIO` together. Note that this slice cannot be placed immediately to the right (in the R0 orientation) of a `*_clamped3_pad` cell, because otherwise they *will* create a supply short. The template IO file contains normal 20um spacer slices explicitly placed at these critical locations, and the provided hook instantiates the `connect` slice in place of the standard 20um spacer. This can be modified if desired. Caravel distributes the `*connect*` slices across the bottom edge of the padframe.

2. Then, in your design YAML file, specify your IO file with the following. The top-level constraint must be exactly as below:

    ```yaml
    technology.sky130.io_file: <path/to/ring.io>
    technology.sky130.io_file_meta: prependlocal

    path: Top
    type: toplevel
    x: 0
    y: 0
    width: 3588
    height: 5188
    margins:
      left: 249.78
      right: 249.78
      top: 252.08
      bottom: 252.08
    ```

3. In your CLIDriver, you must import the following hook from the tech plugin and insert it as a `post_insertion_hook` after `floorplan_design`.

    ```python
    from hammer.technology.sky130 import efabless_ring_io
    ```

    In addition, to ensure ties to `TIE_HI_ESD` / `TIE_LO_ESD` are preserved during synthesis, a `post_insertion_hook` to `init_environment` should be added to `dont_touch` the IO cells

    ```python
    def donttouch_iocells(x: HammerTool) -> bool:
        x.append('set_dont_touch [get_db insts -if {.base_cell.name == sky130_ef_io__*}] true')
        return True
    ```

4. If you want to use the NDA s8iom0s8 library, you must include the `s8io.yml` file with `-p` on the `hammer-vlsi` command line, and then change the cells to that library in the IO file. Net names in the hook above will need to be lower-cased.

5. DRC requires a rectangle of `areaid.lowTapDensity` (GDS layer 81/14) around the core area to check latchup correctly. Currently, this is not yet implemented in Hammer, and will need to be added manually in a GDS editor after GDS streamout.

NDA Files
---------
The NDA version of the Sky130 PDK is only required for Siemens Calibre to perform DRC/LVS signoff with the commercial VLSI flow.
It is NOT REQUIRED for the remaining commercial flow, as well as the open-source tool flow.
Therefore this NDA PDK is not used to generate a GDS.

If you have access to the NDA repo, you should add this path to your Hammer YAML configs:

```yaml
technology.sky130.sky130_nda: "/path/to/skywater-src-nda"
```

We use the Calibre decks in the ``s8`` PDK, version ``V2.0.1``, 
see [here for the DRC deck path](https://github.com/ucb-bar/hammer/blob/612b4b662a774b1cab5cf25e8f41c6a771388e47/hammer/technology/sky130/sky130.tech.json#L16) 
and [here for the LVS deck path](https://github.com/ucb-bar/hammer/blob/612b4b662a774b1cab5cf25e8f41c6a771388e47/hammer/technology/sky130/sky130.tech.json#L24).

Resources
---------
The good thing about this process being open-source is that most questions about the process are answerable through a google search. 
The tradeoff is that the documentation is a bit of a mess, and is currently scattered over a few pages and Github repos. 
We try to summarize these below.
