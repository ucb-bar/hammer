  # Physical flow effort.
  # Valid options: high, medium, and none. Requires Genus Physical Option (GEN40) license and access to the Innovus System.
  # High effort:     Provides the best QoR at the cost of runtime.  Requires Genus_Physical_Opt license.
  # Medium effort:   Offers the best trade-off between the runtime and QoR and turns legalization off by default.  
  # None:            Will result in the best runtime.  Works with all base Genus products.
