  openroad_bin: "openroad" # Location of the binary.
  version: "dummy-value" # this is just to make hammer happy (although, it is never called AFAICT).
  # the version is actually calculated by the OpenROADTool class

  generate_only: false # Generate the TCL file but do not run it yet.

  floorplan_mode: generate # Floorplanning SDC constraints to use.
  # Valid options are:
  # - blank - Specify no floorplanning constraints (likely won't work)
  # - manual - Specify the contents of a manual SDC floorplanning script to use in floorplan_script_contents.
  # - generate - Generate a floorplan from the hammer-vlsi config/IR.
  # - auto - Use Innovus's `plan_design` command to auto-generate a floorplan. Will have poor, but sane results
  #   If you specify this, you must also specify the floorplanning_script config below. The floorplanning_script config will be ignored in other modes.
  # TODO(edwardw): Put in new floorplanning thing here when done.
